# Registry Decoder Live

This project is the live registry hive acquisition component of [Registry Decoder](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/registrydecoder). It is capable of acquiring both the currently running and historical registry files from a number of Windows operating system versions, both 32 and 64 bit.

The acquired files can then be imported into the [offline analysis component](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/registrydecoder) for complete forensic investigation.

###### NOTE

This project is no longer being maintained and is just being hosted here for posterity.
