This project is the live registry hive acquisition component of [Registry Decoder](http://www.registrydecoder.com). It is capable of acquiring both the currently running and historical registry files from a number of Windows operating system versions, both 32 and 64 bit.

The acquired files can then be imported into the [offline analysis component](http://code.google.com/p/registrydecoder/) for complete forensic investigation.

Please see our [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/regdecoderlive/wiki/FAQ) for further information about the project, including supported systems.

The latest version of Registry Decoder can be found in the downloads section as well as complete instructions.

Please join our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/registry-decoder?hl=en) for discussion about the project and announcements about updates and new features.

Registry Decoder was developed and is maintained by developers from [Digital Forensics Solutions](http://www.digitalforensicssolutions.com/).
